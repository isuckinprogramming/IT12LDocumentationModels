The Data Flow Diagram for the IT12L Project of the group of Naranjo, Richard, and Lim. 

I am not sure how to make a data flow diagram, I will just create the processes first then the data for 
each of the process will be labeled and connected to their own process later.

The labels and the connection between the processes and the data containers. I am not sure what to number the data containers, what does the number for the data containers mean? not sure.

The current progress on the DFD.

The numbers on the data containers to be updated.
